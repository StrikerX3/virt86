/*
Defines the interface for virtual processors inside a virtual machine.

The main purpose a virtual processor is to run virtualized code. A virtual
processor enables this through two methods:
- Run(), which runs the virtual processor until a condition causes it to exit
- Step(), which runs a single instruction

Single stepping is only supported on platforms that expose the guestDebugging
feature.

It's also possible to read from and write to physical or linear memory
addresses with MemRead, MemWrite, LMemRead and LMemWrite methods.
Linear address translation will take into account the current VCPU paging mode.
You can also translate a linear address to a physical address using the
LinearToPhysical method.

Various methods are provided to read and write directly to VCPU registers and
control structures.

Interrupts can be enqueued via the EnqueueInterrupt() method. They will be
injected once an interrupt injection window opens. The implementation will
automatically request for interrupt windows or cancel VCPU execution as needed.

For platforms that support guest debugging, it is possible to enable software
breakpoint and define or clear hardware breakpoints, as well as determine the
address of the last breakpoint hit as of the most recent execution.

Optional operations must return the Unsupported status code for platforms that
do not offer support for them. The corresponding methods must be overridden by
platforms that support them.

Some operations, such as bulk register read/write/copy, may be overridden if
the platform offers a more efficient method to perform them. The default
implementation delegates to the singular accessor methods in a loop.

Please note that the VirtualProcessor class is not meant to be shared between
multiple threads. It is, however, possible to use multiple virtual processors
on different threads, as long as each thread uses their own instance.
