/*
Defines the VirtualMachine interface to be implemented by hypervisor adapters.

VirtualMachine instances are created through a Platform object. The parameters
used to create the virtual machine can be retrieved with GetSpecifications().

In order to use a virtual machine, you must retrieve virtual processors created
as part of its initialization using GetVirtualProcessor(index). You may also
map and unmap guest physical address ranges or change protection flags at any
time during the lifetime of the virtual machine, as long as the hypervisor
platform supports the operations. This can be checked by looking at the
platform's features:
- memoryUnmapping for all unmapping operations
- partialUnmapping if you wish to unmap a smaller portion of a mapped GPA range
- guestMemoryProtection to change protection flags of mapped GPA ranges

Some hypervisors also keep track of dirty pages and allow users to read the
dirty bitmap. Check the dirtyPageTracking feature in order to use the dirty
page query methods.

Virtual machines can be destroyed by invoking FreeVM on the platform that
created them. They are also automatically destroyed once the platform is
unloaded. Care must be taken to not use VirtualMachine pointers after a
platform is released.

Please note that VirtualMachine instances are not meant to be used concurrently
by multiple threads. You will need to provide your own concurrency control
mechanism if you wish to share instances between threads.
