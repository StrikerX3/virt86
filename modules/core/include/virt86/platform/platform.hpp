/*
Defines the Platform interface -- the entry point of the library.

A Platform represents a hypervisor platform which can virtualize the x86
processor. Platforms expose a set of optional features, which may be queried
through the GetFeatures() method.

The name of the platform can be retrieved with the GetName() method.

Before using a platform, you must check the initialization status by calling
the GetInitStatus() method. If the return value is not PlatformInitStatus::OK,
the platform has not been initialized successfully.

The main use of a Platform is to create virtual machines. Create a
VMSpecifications struct to specify parameters such as the number of virtual
processors, additional VM exit conditions or custom CPUIDs. Call the CreateVM()
method with it and a pointer to a VirtualMachine pointer variable. If the
virtual machine is created, the function returns true and pointer will refer to
the newly created VM.

Please note that Platform instances are not meant to be used concurrently
by multiple threads. You will need to provide your own concurrency control
mechanism if you wish to share instances between threads.
